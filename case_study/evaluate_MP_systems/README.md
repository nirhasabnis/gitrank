# Are Machine Programming Systems Using Right Source-code Measures to Select Code Repositories?

This directory contains data and scripts used in evaluating if machine
programming systems use right source-code measures to select code repositories.
The paper pertaining to this case study will be published in [The 6th edition of
the International Workshop on Machine Learning Techniques for Software Quality
Evolution](https://maltesque2022.github.io/) in November 2022.

The case study applies GitRank to select different ranked repositories to
evaluate their impact on
[ControlFlag](https://github.com/IntelLabs/control-flag).

# Directory structure

- `scripts`: scripts to produce data reported in Table 2 in the paper
- `experiment1`: the list of 500 repositories used in the experiment, their ranked version,
  and trained models using ControlFlag
- `experiment2`: the list of 250 repositories used in the experiment, their ranked version,
  and trained models using ControlFlag
